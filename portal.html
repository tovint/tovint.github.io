              <h3 class-"card-title">Overview</h3>
              <p class="card-text profile-text">When Invoice2go first launched it was a platform for business owners to create and send documents such as invoices and estimates. One of the biggest opportunities the business has is with payments. We recently launched a platform that allows our users to get paid online from their clients. Our users would benefit by getting paid faster, and the business would benefit with a new stream for revenue. </p>
              <br>
              <h3 class-"card-title">Role and team</h3>
              <p class="card-text profile-text">I worked as the only designer for this project. The team size was large and across two offices (Redwood City, and Sydney). This is was a big initiative for the company and the project lasted about 6 months. </p>
              <br><br>
              <h3 class-"card-title">Workflow</h3>

              <br>
              <p class="card-text">Our design process for approaching projects</p>
              <br>
              <h3 class-"card-title">Initial discovery</h3>
                <p class="card-text profile-text">Before diving into designs, I worked closely with two product managers on setting up time to interview customers. We first sent out a survey to our highly enganged users, and then emailed participants that said they were happy to talk to us more about the product. We conducted 10 interviews over 2 weeks. We got a lot of insight on how customers wanted the product to work and identified a few must haves. <strong> Security </strong> and <strong> Trust </strong> were very important to our customers. Since we would be taking credit card information we needed our platform to feel legitimate. </p>
              <br>
              <h3 class-"card-title">Design Sprints</h3>
                <p class="card-text profile-text">After gathering insights from customers, the first thing we did was kick off a workshop with 8 participants. The workshop was 2 hours long. The first hour was focused on understanding customer personas and stories. The second hour was split into quick design sprints within teams. The design sprints were focused on creating directional designs based on the research and the scenarios we developed. </p>

              <h3 class-"card-title">Low-fidelity screens </h3>
                <p class="card-text profile-text"> After the workshop we moved into creating low-fidelity screens. From customer reasearch and the workshop it was clear that we needed to design the following:

                  <ul>
                    <li> Business owner branding on the payments portal </li>
                    <li> Checkout experience and types of payment methods </li>
                    <li> Making the design responsive for web and mobile web </li>
                  </ul>

                  <br>

                <img class="card-img-top pad-box" src="img/portal-fidelity-1.png" alt="" width="50px">
                <p class="card-text">First iteration of a responsive layout</p><br>
                <img class="card-img-top pad-box" src="img/portal-fidelity-2.png" alt="">
                <p class="card-text">Separated the payments portal into three sections: business brand, payment section, rendered document</p><br>
                <img class="card-img-top pad-box" src="img/portal-fidelity-3.png" alt="">
                <p class="card-text">More detailed iteration of the portal for mobile</p><br>
                <img class="card-img-top pad-box" src="img/portal-fidelity-4.png" alt="">
                <p class="card-text">Web layout for the portal</p><br>
              
              <br>
              <h3 class-"card-title">A/B Testing </h3>
                <p class="card-text profile-text">During the design process we wanted to test out variations of two parts of the portal. The first was different types of credit card forms. We wanted to test the placement of the payment methods as well as different types of form designs. This was a key part of the design, because we wanted to from to feel and look legitimate. We looked at industry standards from some of the most succesful checkout flows such as Amazon to create these variations.</p>
               <img class="card-img-top" src="img/cardform-1.png" alt="" width="50px">
               <img class="card-img-top" src="img/cardform-2.png" alt="" width="50px">
               <br><br><br>
               <p class="card-text profile-text">The second part of the design we wanted to test was the branding element at the top. When end customers hit the portal to pay an invoice we needed to show elements of the business owners brand to create trust in the site. We tested between a strong brand headling versus a subtle variation.</p>
