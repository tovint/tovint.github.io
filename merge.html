              <p class="card-text profile-text">This was the first project I worked on after graduating college. I joined a 4 person startup that focused on optimizing video and photo storage. We were looking to offer a better solution for storing media files than DropBox or Google Drive. During my time there I worked on the design of the product, but also a bit of front-end development.</p>
              <p class="card-text profile-text"> A few months in, we pivoted towards building a way to share photos and videos with your friends. That's where JustMerge was born. JustMerge was an easy way for you to share photos and videos with friends at the same location. Say you were at a concert and were taking photos and videos. You could start a shared album with other friends who were also at the concert. JustMerge would handle all the syncing across each of your devices. All you had to do was point and click.
